  <h1>About This Tool</h1>

  <p>
    The <strong>Easy Boolean Builder for Naukri Recruiters</strong> was created for one purpose: to make life easier for recruiters.
  </p>

  <p>
    As someone who's spent 19+ years in hiring — from startups to large enterprises — I know how painful Boolean logic can be. Naukri's search is powerful, but not recruiter-friendly. You shouldn't need to memorize parentheses and operators just to find great candidates.
  </p>

  <p>
    This tool solves that by turning a complex task into a simple interface. You focus on keywords. It handles the rest.
  </p>

  <h2>Who I Am</h2>
  <p>
    I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishaldembla1/" target="_blank">Vishal Dembla</a>, a recruiter, builder, and open-source advocate. I've led hiring across industries — from CXO searches to volume ramp-ups. I've worked with 500+ companies, advised founders, and even created one of India’s earliest resume tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe tools like this should be free, open, and built with love — not hidden behind paywalls.
  </p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    This isn’t just about Boolean logic. It’s about making like easier for Recruiters!
  </p>

  <p>
    Every second saved here is a second earned back for candidate conversations, for thoughtful hiring, and for doing the real work that matters.
